Overview

This project implements a high-precision computational model to approximate the **Golden Ratio** using the Fibonacci sequence. As the Fibonacci sequence progresses, the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers converges to the Golden Ratio 

The model utilizes the mpmat library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic to compute Fibonacci ratios with high precision, allowing for an approximation of the Golden Ratio up to 150 decimal places.



High Precision**: Approximates the Golden Ratio with up to 150 decimal places.
Efficient Calculation**: Fibonacci numbers are computed iteratively withO((n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
Optimized for Large N's The larger the value of N the closer the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers approaches the Golden Ratio.
